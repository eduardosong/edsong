This is my personal website, built with React.js. It displays my work history as a coder along with projects I've finished or am working on.

I began this project with a few goals in mind:

- Responsive design: functions and displays well on the displays of all devices
- Pretty: Use a simple and organized layout with simple animations to complement the content

I used technologies I'm familiar with to build this website, mainly React.js. I found it helpful to use components to cut down on writing blocks and easily edit the information of my site.

The website is hosted on Netlify.
